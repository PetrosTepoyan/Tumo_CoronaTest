# Tumo_CoronaTest

Note
I tested the application for iOS on iPhone 11 Pro Max simulator. For Android I just have converted the .swift files to .kt files. I understand that this is a highly unprofessional approach; I cannot do any other way, as I do not know Kotlin and just have got introduced to React Native. My skills in Swift will outweigh React Native for a very long time from now, thatâ€™s why you can read this [swift-react-native-hybrid](https://github.com/solium/swift-react-native-hybrid) . If you are developing an app under React Native, maybe my Swift skills may still be useful.
